- 👋 Hi, I’m @tolgaerok
- 👀 I want to learn how to share my unique Linux discoveries with the community.
- 🌱 I'm trying to work with others to develop automated bash scripts that will make fresh Linux installations simple,
- 💞️ but I don't know how to create tags on github because I'm still learning how to use it properly.
